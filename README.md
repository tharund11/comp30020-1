# Word Puzzle Game
This was my submission for Declarative Programming (COMP30020) - Project 1. The task was to design a word puzzle solver in Prolog that will solve the puzzle, given the word grid and list of words. The program repeatedly transposes grid to fill words into slots, dealing with the longer words first.
